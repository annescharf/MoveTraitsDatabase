# MoveTraitsDatabase

As we are many, and to not lose oversight, I would like to ask all to provide contributions as follows:

1. create a Fork from this repository (button "Fork" at the top right)
2. make changes in your Fork (that will be on your github account). You can clone your github repository on RStudio (read how to do it e.g. [here](https://happygitwithr.com/rstudio-git-github.html)).
3. make a Pull Request to the original repository (button "Contribute" top left).
4. use the button "Sync fork" to keep up to date with the original repository.
